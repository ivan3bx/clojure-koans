# Clojure Notes
- 'subvec' indexes are inclusive (start) and exclusive (end).  Same as String#substring
- (doc map) --> gets documentation for 'map' function
---

Maps
----
- hash-map -> /new map/
- count, get, contains?,
- (assoc a b) -> /a+b/


REPL
----
lein repl


###Functions
- Partial functions are different than curried functions
    - They evaluate as soon as they are given arguments
